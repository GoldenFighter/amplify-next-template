# Contest System Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**
The original system used generic task analysis prompts, resulting in inconsistent and irrelevant AI responses. Users wanted:
- Each board to be a specific contest with consistent judging criteria
- Strict scoring based on contest-specific metrics
- Better presentation of contest information and results

## âœ¨ **Key Improvements Made**

### 1. **Contest-Specific Data Model**
- Added `contestPrompt` - The specific question/instruction for submissions
- Added `contestType` - Category of contest (e.g., "Boy Names", "Recipes", "Designs")
- Added `judgingCriteria` - Array of specific criteria for scoring
- Added `maxScore` - Customizable maximum score for each contest

### 2. **Enhanced Board Creation & Editing**
- **CreateBoard**: New fields for contest configuration
- **BoardEdit**: Full editing of all contest properties
- **Form Validation**: Proper handling of contest-specific data

### 3. **Improved Board Display**
- **Contest Type**: Prominently displayed under board name
- **Contest Question**: Highlighted in blue box for clarity
- **Judging Criteria**: Displayed as badges for easy reference
- **Max Score**: Shows the scoring scale for the contest

### 4. **Contest-Specific AI Generation**
- **New AI Route**: `scoreContest` with contest-aware system prompt
- **Consistent Judging**: AI uses board's criteria and scoring system
- **Fallback Support**: Generic scoring for legacy boards

### 5. **Enhanced Submission Interface**
- **Context-Aware Prompts**: Shows contest question when submitting
- **Better Labels**: "Submit Entry" instead of "Submit for AI Analysis"
- **Contest Information**: Displays what users should submit

### 6. **Improved Results Display**
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Shows rating out of contest's max score
- **Contest Context**: Displays contest type in submissions view
- **Better Organization**: Clearer presentation of contest results

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### Data Schema Updates
```typescript
Board: {
  // ... existing fields
  contestPrompt: string,           // Contest question/instruction
  contestType: string,             // Type of contest
  judgingCriteria: string[],       // Scoring criteria
  maxScore: number,                // Maximum possible score
}
```

### New AI Generation Route
```typescript
scoreContest: {
  systemPrompt: "You are a contest judge...",
  arguments: {
    submission: string,            // User's entry
    contestType: string,           // Contest category
    contestPrompt: string,         // Contest question
    judgingCriteria: string[],     // Scoring criteria
    maxScore: number,              // Maximum score
  }
}
```

### Smart Scoring Logic
- **Contest Boards**: Use `scoreContest` with board-specific criteria
- **Legacy Boards**: Fall back to generic `scoreTask` scoring
- **Consistent Results**: Same criteria applied to all submissions in a contest
